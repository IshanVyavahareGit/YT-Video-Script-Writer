                Instructions:
                Imagine you're a viewer about to click on the video. Based on the title and description, think about what key questions or concerns you would have.
                Generate 5 distinct and concise questions that reflect a viewer's curiosity.
                The output must only contain short, distinct questionsâ€”no explanations or additional information. Each question should be clear and simple.
                Format the output exactly as a Python list of strings, with each question as a separate string.
                Video title: {self.videoTitle}
                Idea description: {self.ideaDescription}

                Output format:
                Return the questions as an array of strings that can be type casted using the python list function
                Output: Only generate 5 questions in the form of an array of strings in a single line and nothing else.
