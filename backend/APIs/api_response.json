single day so to always have something to do but one day I was watching this documentary on sea turtles and it said that sea turtles can live up to 150 years of age and I realized as a six-year-old kid and I'm probably not gonna live that long I'm gonna die it was such a strange realization don't you feel weird sometimes when you realize that no matter what you do in life still gonna die in the end so I ran to my mother and asked your mom is it cuter we're all gonna die someday you me dad my friends and she said yes we're all gonna die there's nothing you can do about that and I was terrified I started to cry I cried so hard because of what death meant it literally means the end of existence the end of everything and I wondered what's the point of all this so I turned to my mom still crying and said so why do we work why do I have to work what does dad have to work so much if he and everybody else are gonna die anyway she never answered my question but that question stuck with me ask myself a lot of questions and I'm sure you do too that's what philosophy is all about asking questions and what could be more important than asking questions about how to use your time probably nothing because time is all we have so naturally you would expect the hold time management movement to be very philosophical after all time management is a concept that started out in philosophy the ancient philosophers were obsessed with this one very important question how can we use our time in a way that makes our lives meaningful but modern time management is philosophically empty time management books are written by consultants not philosophers it's always about tips and tricks and techniques to get more things done to do things faster to be more productive more efficient and to work better time management has become philosophically empty time management has moved away from his philosophical roots but if we really want to live a meaningful life we have to once again reinforce and philosophy starts with questions here's a very simple question why do we need to manage time some people might say it's because time is precious very precious so we need to manage it but how precious is time exactly see whenever I introduced myself to people as a time management researcher the first thing people say is oh yeah time management it's that's really important because because time is money time is money every time I hear time is money it reminds me of this conversation I had over coffee with this acquaintance of mine he was a he was a contractor as what we're talking he looked slightly annoyed and impatient so I asked him Jeff what's going on man everything all right and he said she said I hate wasting my time makes me so so angry it's awesome what do you mean and he said look I make on in 60 dollars an hour that means every hour I spend with you I'm losing 160 bucks I was slightly offended to be honest but it's what he said next that really shocked me he said whenever I'm spending time with my own kids it makes me so angry because yeah i'm spending time with them but every hour i spend with my kids I'm not making $160 and it's not just an anecdote you can see this everywhere experiments show that whenever people start to think of time as money they become more agitated less happy always in a rush and importantly they get greedy they become less likely to help people out to volunteer or to think about the environment because nothing else matters when you're making out in $60 an hour the real question is is money the real value of time the Roman philosopher Seneca said that if we think of time as money we're actually valuing our time very cheaply we value our time very cheaply because we think we're we have a lot of it because we think we're gonna live forever but we're not gonna live forever we're gonna die and the moment you realize and I mean fully realized that you're going to die on an $60 an hour it won't mean much time is not money anymore now some people might say that thinking about death is not exactly cheerful maybe but it's very helpful the French philosopher Albert Camus said that the most fundamental question in philosophy is why shouldn't I kill myself right now it's true why shouldn't kill you why shouldn't you kill yourself right now your answer to that question will remind you what you're truly living for your answer to that question will remind you of the true value of your time because time is not money when you know you're going to die and this is how philosophy helps with time management it helps us ask meaningful questions about time here's another seemingly simple question can you manage time back in college I had this uh.this professor used to tell me that you can't manage time time management is you can't manage time because there's too much too many things to do too much work to do too many obligations you can't manage time she's to publicly brag about how she never sees her daughter because she has she never has time people admired her because she was so productive but what people didn't know was that her work obligations also made her depressed they cost her a marriage and of course she never really got to know our daughter but what truly pains me is that things could have been otherwise she could've been all out she could have been alive today and see her daughter grew up but she didn't believe that time could be managed so she never tried whenever I used to drop by her office she would tell me sorry kiddo I don't have time but that was a lie I don't have time is the biggest lie in the history of mankind you know who really didn't have time your great grandparents those guys had no time at all they had to work 12 hours a day every single day it's not just work everything back then was more time-consuming people didn't have washing machines so they'd have to wash everything by hand they didn't have frozen meals so that to cook everything from scratch and all those things took hours to do back in the days that's why a great grandparents really didn't have time but here's the incredible thing our great-grandparents did not complain about not having time we do it's a paradox we have more time than they did and yet we still complain that we don't have time why because we have more options more freedom to choose our time options as we please look at how we live today we can shop on Amazon 24/7 any day of the year women can delay pregnancy by freezing their eggs more and more companies offer flexible work schedules we can watch our favorite shows any time I want on Netflix so not only do we have more time but we have also have a lot more flexibility a lot more a lot more freedom to use our time as we please and we still say that we don't have time why the philosopher jean-paul Sartre has said that we have this tendency to trick ourselves into thinking we're not free because being free to use your time as you please means that you have to make a choice and live with the consequences of that choice that mean that means whatever you do with your time it's on you and that's the scary part it's scary because what if we made the wrong choices what if we're missing out it's this constant fear of missing out would your life have been better had you spent more time with your kids or more time studying or more time partying maybe we don't want to know that's why we say we don't have time it gives us an excuse it's reassuring but in reality we do have time and time can be managed it's just that we don't have a lot of it so they have to be sacrifices we can't have it all when it comes to time we can either make sacrifices or make excuses but only one of them will allow you to live meaningfully we live in an era of unprecedented flexibility where we actually afford to work less and do more meaningful things with our time so why don't we and by we I really mean us you me and everybody else in the city because time management is not just about you it's about all of us it's about all of us as a society the way you manage your time has huge consequences for our world what do people say when they don't vote I didn't have time what do people say we didn't read I don't have time why don't people relax go the museum or volunteer I don't have time but this wouldn't be the case if we thought about time management the way philosophers do by asking questions the right questions instead of focusing on tips tricks and shortcuts so what kind of questions can we ask ourselves well is it reasonable to let you boss call you on weekends is it worth it is it worth your time and buy time I really mean life not money because you're not paying your bosses with some with some commodity you're paying them with your time you're paying them with your life if that's not precious I don't know what is next time you tell a friend you don't have time to hang out ask yourself if you actually have better things to do or if you're just making excuses because there's a growing sense of isolation in Western societies people feel alone partly because people feel they don't have time to hang out anymore though we do have time so please share it with the people you care about if you can remember if you want to if you want to manage your time meaningfully embrace philosophy and never stop asking questions thank you

began transmitting incredible, iconic images back to Earth. But several days in,  something went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect,  procrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied  but failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out,  in its scheduler. Every operating system has something  called the scheduler that tells the CPU how long to work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly  between their various responsibilities, they give the illusion  of doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens when things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else,  some measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science  of scheduling can give us some ideas about our own human struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all  the time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check  your inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one,  you repeat. Seems sensible,  but there's a problem here. This is what's known  as a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as full, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do  twice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers  of the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single  one of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time  ranking tasks than doing them. The programmers\u2019 counterintuitive solution was to replace this full ranking with a limited number  of priority \u201cbuckets.\u201d The system was less precise  about what to do next but more than made up for it  by spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always  doing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller  than normal could take nine times longer to clear. You\u2019d be better off replying  in chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up  on doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges  from computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent  features of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes  from one task to another, it has to do what's called  a context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory  and new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there\u2019s  a fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done  means minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting  anytime something comes up. These two principles  are fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where  we want to strike that balance. The obvious solution  is to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification  or email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that\u2019s exactly how often  you should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by  the name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with  things as they come up \u2013 Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? \u2013 the system groups these  interruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement  in laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions  lets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users  to reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things that feels so rare in modern life: rest."}, {"Metadata": {"id": "W8B0KWmv_-Q", "title": "Tools for Better Productivity & Time Management | Dr. Adam Grant & Dr. Andrew Huberman", "view_count": "176229", "duration": 578, "upload_date": "March 18, 2024", "formatted_view_count": "176.23K views", "formatted_duration": "00:09:38"}, "Transcript": "I think it was E.B. White who said, \"I arise in the morning, \"torn between the desire to enjoy the world \"and the desire to improve the world, \"and this makes it difficult to plan the day.\" And I feel that every day. I think, I mean, I even, I felt it this morning. I was like, okay, it's time to leave to come to the Huberman podcast. I'm like, wait, but I didn't hit my minimum sunlight viewing. So what do I do? Do I show up on time for you or do I meet your criteria? The explanation \"I was getting my morning sunlight, \"and therefore I'm x number of minutes or even hours late\" would've been completely fine with me. I figured as much. Yes, absolutely. Like that's a built-in acceptable excuse with you. I think, I mean, I think everybody experiences a version of this, and it's definitely gotten worse with social media and with smartphones. I think, so one of the most startling data points for me was Gloria Mark first put this on my radar, before COVID, the average person was checking email 72 times a day. How do you ever concentrate for more than a couple minutes if you're self interrupting that often? You can't. Brigid Schulte has a great term for this. She calls it time confetti, and she says, we're taking these meaningful blocks of time, and we're slicing them up into these like tiny little dots of confetti. And not only can we not accomplish anything, we're also eroding our own sense of joy because it's really hard to enjoy the, you know, the 30-second blip of time that you get on a task. And I think we know a lot more about the existence of these problems than how to solve them, but one thing we do know is blocking out uninterrupted time is meaningful. There's a great Leslie Perlow experiment where she takes engineers, and she has them, she sets a quiet time policy. No interruptions Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon, 65% above average productivity. Could you repeat the protocol again? Yeah, so quiet time, there are a couple iterations of it, but I think the most effective one was Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, no meetings, no interruptions, no Slack, no emails before noon. And during those periods of no interruptions, one could tend to whatever their primary purpose is at work. Yeah, you have a. So for me, it might be podcasting. Obviously I don't have my phone in here and never do, but it doesn't mean no interaction with anyone else. It just means focusing on the major task. The task, exactly. And you come in with a clear sense of priority and purpose, and I don't think there's anything magical about Tuesday, Thursday, Friday before noon. It's just the idea of setting a boundary and collectively committing to it that seems to be important. And I think, you know, when I think about this, I'd be really curious about your take on chronotypes here because I think one thing I've learned in the last couple years is that if you're a morning person, you do your best analytical and creative thinking in the morning. And so the quiet time block would work very well for me as a morning person. If you're a night owl, you probably want that block in the late afternoon. And I was encouraged, there was some evidence during COVID that people have their best meetings right after lunch, that they're something like 30% less likely to multitask in an after lunch meeting. And I guess, you know, you could probably unpack like the food coma, you know, getting re-energized by other people. But it's led me to wonder if we should all be protecting the first few hours and the last few hours of the day for deep work, and then doing our core meetings and interactions and kind of off task activities in the middle. What do you think about that as a sequence? Yeah, well, I have a lot of questions about this for you, but I love that sequence. It certainly fits with my natural rhythms. I think there's ample evidence to support the fact that provided one is sleeping well at night and is on a more or less a standard schedule. When I say standard, I mean going to bed somewhere between let's say 9:30 and 11:30 PM. Waking up sometime between, let's say 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM, maybe 5:30 to 7:30, something like that. So not highly unusual night owl or super early bird. For people that are following that sort of schedule, the first, let's just say from zero to eight hours after waking, there tends to be a fairly robust increase in all the catecholamines. So dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine in which generally, okay, generally speaking, lead to increases in alertness, attention and focus that are great for analytic work, great for implementation of strategies that you already understand and you need to churn through a lot of stuff. And of course, there's a big increase in the morning, especially if you view morning sunlight, a healthy increase, I should say in cortisol. Cortisol is not bad, folks. You want cortisol, but you want that peak early in the day. We know that. Okay, so for most people it seems, at least my understanding is that that period of time, zero to eight or eight hours after waking or so, is best devoted to the quote unquote most critical tasks. But one of the common problems is that people take that ability to implement a known strategy, and they start battering back all the emails or talking to all, by the way, talking to coworkers is great, and it's often required, but it's, the question is whether or not it's productive conversation or whether or not it's just conversation. And we tend to have a lot of energy early in the day, and I'm obsessed with the idea of neural energy as opposed to just caloric energy. So there we're talking about neural energy, and then post-lunch, so really as we get to this sort of, you know, nine to 17 hours after waking, there is a dip in autonomic arousal that during the middle of the day that post perennial dip, there's a post-lunch sleepiness that can be partially offset by delaying your morning caffeine a bit if you have the afternoon crash. But it's interesting that you note that more productive meetings and less task switching and distraction occurred in meetings set after lunch because that makes me think that perhaps being a little bit less alert is going to lend itself to more focus. And indeed, that's the sort of optimal state, relaxed, but focused, you know, you're not sleepy, but you also don't have so much intrinsic energy that you're, you know, Bouncing off the walls. Tending to a bunch of things because I think a lot of people do feel that way. You know, and I'm drinking, you know, double espresso right now, late mid morning, late morning, and you know, I can sit still, but I think certain Zoom meetings, how do I say this? I don't want to offend any of my colleagues. I mean, they are boring enough, like they are not content rich enough to grab all my attention. And nowadays, of course there are multiple screens. Typically I've got two phones and a computer, and you have to really spend some work to flip over those phones while I'm on a Zoom and things like that, so maybe. Sorry, what were you saying? I wasn't listening. So it's maybe the reduction in autonomic arousal that supports what you just described, but I don't know. My thinking or my understanding rather was that creative work and kind of brainstorming was best accomplished in the late afternoon. I've noticed when lecturing, I'd be curious what your experience is with in university lectures, when I held courses in the evening, I used to like to hold my courses five to 7:00 PM or even seven to 9:30 PM when I was teaching undergraduates that people were much looser and more relaxed. And I always thought that that might have something to do with an increase in GABA transmission that's known to happen late in late evening. The people are just kind of more relaxed, and less social anxiety. They've been around people for much of the day. They're warmed up. I send back more reflections than answers. I don't have any firm neuroscience explanations for what you described, but there are some emerging theories about how that might work. And it has this zero to nine hours phase one, nine to 17 hours, phase two. And then of course, from 17 to 24 hours, I'll call it phase three, you should be asleep. Yeah. Ideally. Well, that I think there's a confound in your teaching experience, which is undergrads often sleep in until what? Noon. True. Or they might be up until 4:00 AM. Or at least 10:00 AM seems to be a typical rise time. Yes. For the undergraduate. So a morning class might be too early for them to be fully awake, but there is, there's some brand new evidence that on, at least on creativity at work, I read a series of, I think it was three studies recently showing that early birds actually did do more creative work in the morning. And in part, I think, again the, I don't think any neuroscientist has touched the mechanisms on this yet, but in terms of the psychological processes, early on there's just, there seems to be a benefit of the energy level and some of that energy leads to more divergent thinking. And later, if you're a morning person, you might lose the ability to diverge quite as much. And so you end up in a more conventional space of thought. Does that track at all with your understanding of how it might play out in the brain? My understanding is it would be a little bit, it would be individual, but you know, there is something to these liminal states between sleep and waking. So maybe we can wrap a convenient bow around what I said and what you just said, which is that we know that in the transition states into and out of sleep, and it doesn't necessarily have to be within the first half hour in and out of sleep, that there seems to be more divergent thinking or at least activation of neural networks that are not as constrained as one observes when they're in a sheer task and strategy implementation mode.
